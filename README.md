# RootCellar App – Project Outline

## Project Description
RootCellar is a mobile application designed to help users track, store, and manage their food supplies. The goal is to provide a simple, organized system to monitor pantry items, expiration dates, and quantities so users can reduce waste and save money.

## Problem Addressing
Many people struggle with food management at home—forgetting expiration dates, losing track of what’s in storage, or overbuying. RootCellar solves this problem by creating a digital pantry that sends reminders, organizes items, and makes it easier to plan meals.

## Platform
- Android (initial development)
- Future expansion potential: cross-platform (iOS)

## Front/Back End Support
- **Front End:** Android Studio, Java/Kotlin, XML for UI layouts  
- **Back End:** Firebase or SQLite for data storage, GitHub for version control

## Functionality
- Add, edit, and delete pantry items  
- Categorize food by type (grains, canned goods, frozen, etc.)  
- Track expiration dates and receive alerts  
- Search and filter items  
- Simple reporting (items expiring soon, inventory lists)

## Design (Wireframes)
- **Home Screen:** Overview of pantry categories and quick stats  
- **Add Item Screen:** Form to enter item name, category, quantity, and expiration date  
- **Inventory List Screen:** Scrollable list with filter/search options  
- **Alerts/Reminders Screen:** Shows items about to expire  


## Module Progress Outcome
By completing this outline and setting up the repository:
- The project goals and scope are clearly defined.  
- The app outline is documented in both Word and GitHub (README + Wiki).  
- Tools (Android Studio, GitHub) are installed and connected.  
- The project is framed and ready for development in future modules.
